## SIZE COMPARISON
# EXPERIMENT 3
# AIM
To study and implement C++ Program Structure 

# THEORY
The sizeof operator in C++ shows the size in bytes of a data type or variable. It's evaluated at compile-time, returns a size value, and is commonly used for:

Checking data type sizes,
Memory allocation,
Array size calculations.

It works with variables, types, and expressions. The size can vary across platforms. It's particularly useful for low-level memory management and ensuring code portability.

# CODE
## OUTPUT
# CONCLUSION

LEARNT HOW TO CHECK THE SIZE OF ANY OPERATOR IN C++.
